# Cube-Clock
An interactive HTML5/CCS3 demo featuring time and date on the faces of a cube that is 'fragile'--sensitive to cursor/touch-screen incursion.  You break it, you fix it!---or wait for the FixiT button. The cube does a modest dance every fresh minute, and a major turn (involving a cuckoo) on the hour.
